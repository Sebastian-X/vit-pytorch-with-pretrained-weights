## Vision Transformer - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy">Vision Transformer</a>, a simple way to achieve SOTA in vision classification with only a single transformer encoder, in Pytorch. Significance is further explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4">Yannic Kilcher's</a> video. There's really not much to code here, but may as well lay it out for everyone so we expedite the attention revolution.

For a Pytorch implementation with pretrained models, please see Ross Wightman's repository <a href="https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models">here</a>.

The official Jax repository is <a href="https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer">here</a>.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install vit-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import ViT

v = ViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
mask = torch.ones(1, 8, 8).bool() # optional mask, designating which patch to attend to

preds = v(img, mask = mask) # (1, 1000)
```

## Parameters
- `image_size`: int.  
Image size. If you have rectangular images, make sure your image size is the maximum of the width and height
- `patch_size`: int.  
Number of patches. `image_size` must be divisible by `patch_size`.  
The number of patches is: ` n = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2` and `n` **must be greater than 16**.
- `num_classes`: int.  
Number of classes to classify.
- `dim`: int.  
Last dimension of output tensor after linear transformation `nn.Linear(..., dim)`.
- `depth`: int.  
Number of Transformer blocks.
- `heads`: int.  
Number of heads in Multi-head Attention layer. 
- `mlp_dim`: int.  
Dimension of the MLP (FeedForward) layer. 
- `channels`: int, default `3`.  
Number of image's channels. 
- `dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0.`.  
Dropout rate. 
- `emb_dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0`.  
Embedding dropout rate.
- `pool`: string, either `cls` token pooling or `mean` pooling

## Distillation

<img src="./distill.png" width="300px"></img>

A recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877">paper</a> has shown that use of a distillation token for distilling knowledge from convolutional nets to vision transformer can yield small and efficient vision transformers. This repository offers the means to do distillation easily.

ex. distilling from Resnet50 (or any teacher) to a vision transformer

```python
import torch
from torchvision.models import resnet50

from vit_pytorch.distill import DistillableViT, DistillWrapper

teacher = resnet50(pretrained = True)

v = DistillableViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

distiller = DistillWrapper(
    student = v,
    teacher = teacher,
    temperature = 3,           # temperature of distillation
    alpha = 0.5                # trade between main loss and distillation loss
)

img = torch.randn(2, 3, 256, 256)
labels = torch.randint(0, 1000, (2,))

loss = distiller(img, labels)
loss.backward()

# after lots of training above ...

pred = v(img) # (2, 1000)
```

The `DistillableViT` class is identical to `ViT` except for how the forward pass is handled, so you should be able to load the parameters back to `ViT` after you have completed distillation training.

You can also use the handy `.to_vit` method on the `DistillableViT` instance to get back a `ViT` instance.

```python
v = v.to_vit()
type(v) # <class 'vit_pytorch.vit_pytorch.ViT'>
```

## Token-to-Token ViT

<img src="./t2t.png" width="400px"></img>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11986">This paper</a> proposes that the first couple layers should downsample the image sequence by unfolding, leading to overlapping image data in each token as shown in the figure above. You can use this variant of the `ViT` as follows.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.t2t import T2TViT

v = T2TViT(
    dim = 512,
    image_size = 224,
    depth = 5,
    heads = 8,
    mlp_dim = 512,
    num_classes = 1000,
    t2t_layers = ((7, 4), (3, 2), (3, 2)) # tuples of the kernel size and stride of each consecutive layers of the initial token to token module
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## Masked Patch Prediction

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zankner">Zach</a>, you can train using the original masked patch prediction task presented in the paper, with the following code.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import ViT
from vit_pytorch.mpp import MPP

model = ViT(
    image_size=256,
    patch_size=32,
    num_classes=1000,
    dim=1024,
    depth=6,
    heads=8,
    mlp_dim=2048,
    dropout=0.1,
    emb_dropout=0.1
)

mpp_trainer = MPP(
    transformer=model,
    patch_size=32,
    dim=1024,
    mask_prob=0.15,          # probability of using token in masked prediction task
    random_patch_prob=0.30,  # probability of randomly replacing a token being used for mpp
    replace_prob=0.50,       # probability of replacing a token being used for mpp with the mask token
)

opt = torch.optim.Adam(mpp_trainer.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

def sample_unlabelled_images():
    return torch.randn(20, 3, 256, 256)

for _ in range(100):
    images = sample_unlabelled_images()
    loss = mpp_trainer(images)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()

# save your improved network
torch.save(model.state_dict(), './pretrained-net.pt')
```

## Research Ideas

### Self Supervised Training

You can train this with a near SOTA self-supervised learning technique, <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/byol-pytorch">BYOL</a>, with the following code.

(1)
```bash
$ pip install byol-pytorch
```

(2)
```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import ViT
from byol_pytorch import BYOL

model = ViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    mlp_dim = 2048
)

learner = BYOL(
    model,
    image_size = 256,
    hidden_layer = 'to_latent'
)

opt = torch.optim.Adam(learner.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

def sample_unlabelled_images():
    return torch.randn(20, 3, 256, 256)

for _ in range(100):
    images = sample_unlabelled_images()
    loss = learner(images)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()
    learner.update_moving_average() # update moving average of target encoder

# save your improved network
torch.save(model.state_dict(), './pretrained-net.pt')
```

A pytorch-lightning script is ready for you to use at the repository link above.

### Efficient Attention

There may be some coming from computer vision who think attention still suffers from quadratic costs. Fortunately, we have a lot of new techniques that may help. This repository offers a way for you to plugin your own sparse attention transformer.

An example with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902">Nystromformer</a>

```bash
$ pip install nystrom-attention
```

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.efficient import ViT
from nystrom_attention import Nystromformer

efficient_transformer = Nystromformer(
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12,
    heads = 8,
    num_landmarks = 256
)

v = ViT(
    dim = 512,
    image_size = 2048,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    transformer = efficient_transformer
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 2048, 2048) # your high resolution picture
v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

Other sparse attention frameworks I would highly recommend is <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/routing-transformer">Routing Transformer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/sinkhorn-transformer">Sinkhorn Transformer</a>

### Combining with other Transformer improvements

This paper purposely used the most vanilla of attention networks to make a statement. If you would like to use some of the latest improvements for attention nets, please use the `Encoder` from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers">this repository</a>.

ex.

```bash
$ pip install x-transformers
```

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.efficient import ViT
from x_transformers import Encoder

v = ViT(
    dim = 512,
    image_size = 224,
    patch_size = 16,
    num_classes = 1000,
    transformer = Encoder(
        dim = 512,                  # set to be the same as the wrapper
        depth = 12,
        heads = 8,
        ff_glu = True,              # ex. feed forward GLU variant https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202
        residual_attn = True        # ex. residual attention https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11747
    )
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
v(img) # (1, 1000)
```
